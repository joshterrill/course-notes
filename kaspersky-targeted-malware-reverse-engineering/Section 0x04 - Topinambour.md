### History

### Dropper Analysis
1. Load the dropper into ndspy for analysis, you should see a new file get created called topinambour.exe. 
2. We see in the disassembler in the `make_some_noise()` function that it starts a scheduled task called *VerifiedPublisherCertCheck*.  
3. We can grab the payloads for `original` and `payload` from the *Resources* section of the file. Saving them to their own binaries and loading them into  dnspy as well to get more information like the C2 IP addresses. Also in the resources section is the filename that gets dropped, which is *TeamView_Setup_ru.exe*
4. In the client file payload extract, we see some IP's and a port of 13277.
5. Once the payload is dropped, some javascript is sent over that is highly obfuscated which would get executed either by WScript or CScript on the windows OS.
	1. We see that there is a scan parameter that might be needed for later decryption in the `f_CreateScheduledTaskLogin` method, calling `-scan Kdw6gG7cpOSZsBeH`
	2. A second and third layer of base64 decoding also reveals a C2 domain of txflasher.com
